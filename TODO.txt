TODO list for PyClient


HIGH PRIORITY
=============
* Auto-login
* Auto-TA2 mode
* Logging (HTML)
* Ignore TA2 keepalive lines/XML
* Resizing bugs: slow making-it-smaller, not being able to resize it to smaller
* Sensible plugin architecture
  (more for me than for users -- makes it easy to implement this stuff)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
===============
* Tabs for .whisper and .tell
* /ping
* /connect ip:port (or /connect ip port)
* Parse and understand XML from TA
* Command history
* Command name suggestion or autocomplete
* Taskbar flash (can GTK even do this?)

LOW PRIORITY
============
* URL detection is somewhat fragile - if they're broken by a tag or a *pause
  in transmission*, they'll get screwed up
* URL regex is a little wonky and does a lot of false positives
* Protect against link double-click
* Invisible cursor? (right now it's just black)
* Make numpad enter work
* // currently becomes /, but this interferes with pasting C code
* Automatically change from gtk.WRAP_WORD_CHAR to gtk.WRAP_WORD
  (with scroll auto) if we're not running GTK 2.4+
* *Rigorous* ability to /eval multiline bits of Python
* Better command param parsing mechanism
* URL history
* Nicer package-for-distribution system
* Trigger system
* Remove trailing whitespace line (??? - what does this mean?)
  (Maybe it means regarding /eval's that return None!)
