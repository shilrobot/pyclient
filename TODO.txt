TODO list for PyClient

HIGH PRIORITY
=============
* Fix bug that occurs when you close the client while it's minimized causing it not to launch properly again
* Timers
* Look into shit about unicode token parsing. Where is it used, is our implementation correct, etc.
  -- Potential that EV_NORMAL + hex digits = silently broken
  -- AR's version vs. Druink's?
* Configuration dialog
* Auto-login (plugin?)
* Auto-TA2 mode (plugin?)
* Slow to make window smaller as window refreshes (chugging doing text layout)
* Window appears to have large minimum size on Ubuntu

MEDIUM PRIORITY
===============
* Aliasing (/alias)
* Tab completion - both /pyclient commands and .ta commands and names
  -- Possibly with hints for what token you're entering
* Tabs for .whisper and .tell
* Parse and understand XML from TA
  -- Expose to plugins in easy to understand ways
* Command history
* Command name suggestion or autocomplete
* Taskbar flash (can GTK even do this?)
  -- GAIM sure as hell does
  -- At least we could have the title change back and forth

LOW PRIORITY
============
* Remove flicker when launching (possibly due to resizing immediately after creation)
* email detection (separate from url detection)
* Log with hyperlinks inplace
* URL detection is somewhat fragile - if they're broken by a tag or a *pause
  in transmission*, they'll get screwed up
* URL regex is a little wonky and does a lot of false positives
* Protect against link double-click
* Invisible cursor? (right now it's just black)
* *Rigorous* ability to /eval multiline bits of Python
* Better command param parsing mechanism
* URL history
* Nicer package-for-distribution system
* Trigger system
* Remove trailing whitespace line (??? - what does this mean?)
  (Maybe it means regarding /eval's that return None!)
