Stuff that's changed...

0.05 "She Plays Darts Like a Spanner"
* PyClient is resurrected from BEYOND THE GRAVE
* Config information is now placed in the same directory as pyclient
  (No need to make a .pyclient directory, most people are going to run out
   of the directory extracted from a tarball anyway)
* Config information stored in XML format which is cleaner than
  Python pickling
* Config is no longer global
* Fixed some GTK warnings
* Hugely reorganized client to get away from ugly inheritance crap.
* New logo.
* Since elementtree is built into Python from 2.5+, we now use that directly.
* Can now be launched with a different working directory w/o failing.
* No longer creates bogus newlines when we receive XML.
* Removed ta2.TA2Protocol from distribution as it wasn't being used.
* Added HTML logging.

0.04 "Mexican Magic Realism"
* Browser launching now uses standard Python webbrowser.py module.
  This appears to work just as well as using gobject.launch_async,
  and supports more types of browsers (not to mention being
  already tested.) This eliminates the 'apps/browser-command'
  config key.
* Configuration path works on Windows (currently it goes in
  %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.pyclient, e.g.
  C:\Documents and Settings\shilbert\.pyclient
  
0.03 "Sick Sense That Reality Is Broken":
* Configuration system actually loads/saves to ~/.pyclient. Currently this is
  simply a pickled dictionary.
* Added menubar.
* Added toolbar.
* Added statusbar.
* /eval now maintains state between calls. To clear the state, you can go /eval reset.
* All TA protocol related code is abstracted into the module 'ta2'
* Nasty hang-on-exit problem due to Twisted 2.0 fixed.
* PyClient remembers where your window was and how large you had made your input
  text area.

0.02 "Wide-Ranging Tentacle-Oriented Policies":
* TA2 protocol support (may have to go .advproto to turn it on)
* Clickable URLs
* More robust parser
* /quit (closes everything)
* /clear (clears the text pane)
