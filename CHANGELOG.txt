Stuff that's changed...

0.06 untitled
* No longer relies on Twisted. This may help adding more frontends in the future.
* Added basic plugin architecture. Add a module or package to the 'plugins' directory and it will be loaded on startup.
  Please only interface with the client using the 'pyclient.api' module. Examples are in the plugins directory.
  Example plugins at the moment:
    /me -- Emulates /me from IRC clients for people that make that mistake
    /colors -- Shows a colorized list of color codes available in TA 
* Parsing of lines now only occurs in one place, allowing proper "line received" events.
* Config stored as json

0.05 "She Plays Darts Like a Spanner"
* PyClient is resurrected from BEYOND THE GRAVE
* Config information is now placed in the same directory as pyclient
  (No need to make a .pyclient directory, most people are going to run out
   of the directory extracted from a tarball anyway)
* Config information stored in XML format which is cleaner than
  Python pickling
* New logo.
* Config is no longer global
* Fixed some GTK warnings
* Hugely reorganized client to get away from ugly inheritance crap.
* Since elementtree is built into Python from 2.5+, we now use that directly.
* Can now be launched with a different working directory w/o failing.
* No longer creates bogus newlines when we receive XML.
* Removed ta2.TA2Protocol from distribution as it wasn't being used.
* Added HTML logging.
* Removed unnecessary GTK_WRAP_WORD_CHAR constant & associated config setting
  now that this is available in newer versions of PyGTK.
* With new command parser, // actually sends as // so C code pastes right
* /connect ip:port (or /connect ip port)

0.04 "Mexican Magic Realism"
* Browser launching now uses standard Python webbrowser.py module.
  This appears to work just as well as using gobject.launch_async,
  and supports more types of browsers (not to mention being
  already tested.) This eliminates the 'apps/browser-command'
  config key.
* Configuration path works on Windows (currently it goes in
  %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.pyclient, e.g.
  C:\Documents and Settings\shilbert\.pyclient
  
0.03 "Sick Sense That Reality Is Broken":
* Configuration system actually loads/saves to ~/.pyclient. Currently this is
  simply a pickled dictionary.
* Added menubar.
* Added toolbar.
* Added statusbar.
* /eval now maintains state between calls. To clear the state, you can go /eval reset.
* All TA protocol related code is abstracted into the module 'ta2'
* Nasty hang-on-exit problem due to Twisted 2.0 fixed.
* PyClient remembers where your window was and how large you had made your input
  text area.

0.02 "Wide-Ranging Tentacle-Oriented Policies":
* TA2 protocol support (may have to go .advproto to turn it on)
* Clickable URLs
* More robust parser
* /quit (closes everything)
* /clear (clears the text pane)
